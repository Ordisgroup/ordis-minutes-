## 2025-12-23 — Product Decision: First GitHub Automation Product

**Topic:**  
Selection of the first GitHub-based automation product for Ordis

**Summary:**  
A structured review of potential GitHub automation products concluded that the most effective first offering is a GitHub-native Minutes and Decision Logging system. The decision prioritises immediate usefulness, low regulatory risk, strong brand alignment, and extensibility into future paid products.

**Key Points:**  
- The product must be dog-foodable, simple, GitHub-native, and extensible.  
- Broader or abstract systems (e.g. full “Founder OS”) were deferred to later stages.  
- A Minutes & Decisions system provides foundational infrastructure for future Ordis products.  
- Public visibility offers credibility and long-term leverage without exposing sensitive material.  

**Decisions or Actions:**  
- Approve **Ordis Minutes** as the first GitHub automation product.  
- Create public repository named **`ordis-minutes`**.  
- Set repository visibility to **Public**, with internal usage maintained separately in a private repo.  
- Scope v1 strictly to templates, structure, and light GitHub Actions (no dashboards or SaaS).
